# Project 2: Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a model-free method to to find the best policy for three different Markov decision processes given sampled transitions. The methods used are described in *Algorithms for Decision Making* (Kochenderfer et al., Chapter 17).

A simple Q-learning algorithm is used to iteratively find the optimal policy for each dataset.
