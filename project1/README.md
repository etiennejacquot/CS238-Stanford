Project aimed at learning learn the structure of Bayesian networks that best fit given datasets using a scoring-based approach. 

A simple hill-climbing algorithm is implemented to iteratively modify the network and maximize the Bayesian score. The goal is to discover high-scoring structures efficiently while keeping computation time reasonable.
