# Project 1 — Bayesian Structure Learning

This project implements a scoring-based approach to learn the structure of Bayesian networks, following the methods described in *Algorithms for Decision Making* (Kochenderfer et al., Chapter 7).

A simple hill-climbing algorithm is used to iteratively modify the network and maximize the Bayesian score, identifying structures that best explain the given data.

The goal is to efficiently discover high-scoring network topologies while maintaining reasonable computation time.
